# Meeting Summary

## Task: 
- Please summarize this meeting. Make sure there is a brief overview of the discussed. It doesn't need to be a protocol.
- But make sure that everything **important** is hightlighted, such as **decisions**, **action items**, **priorities**, **roadblocks**.
- In case it adds context or is important, add who suggested, asked or decided something or who had a strong opinion.
- At the end, highlight if there are potential misunderstandings or misalignments and what might have caused them.
- Don't include any smalltalk or discussion about the meeting itself (e.g. technical issues with Microsoft Teams). Focus only on what's relevant and related to the topic of the meeting.
- In case there are off-topic discussions, separate them into a separate section.
- Don't link the the linked documents that contains the transcript.
- At the end, add a section for Additional information and links.
    - Official Vendor documentation regarding the topic (if available)
    - Related files on Sharepoint (if available)
    - Related Tickets in ALM Octane (if available)
    - Related pages in Confluence (if available)
- Don't include any empty sections in case there is no content. E.g. don't include the "Decisions" sections in case no decisions have been taken or don't include "Additional information" in case there is nothing related.
- Create the meeting summary in english, regardless of the spoken language or the language of provided notes.
